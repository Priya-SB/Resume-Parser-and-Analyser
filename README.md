for company view

-----------------
Download Input files :- hardskills.txt, softskills.txt <br>
and test on the 3 different resumes and 1 jd in sample input folder.

----------------
Candidate View and Company View Frames added along with all the database connectivity.

Download and import the database to MySQL.
Download the branch code.
Start using it like a normal application by signing up and uploading resumes. You don't have to explicitly call the parser function. It'll be called once at the beginning or at any upload.
For ease of maintenance I've created three sub-folders in the root folder namely Jds, Resumes, Extracted where all jds, resumes and extracted kyword files will be stored so make sure you're uploading from that file.

Apart from this I couldn't figure out how to display the output in GUI so for the time being it prints on terminal.
